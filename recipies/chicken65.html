    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
        
        </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup fresh curry leaves, chopped, or more to taste
        
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt
        
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder
        
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander
        
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala
        
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix chicken, curry leaves, yogurt, garlic paste, chili powder, coriander, garam masala, and ginger together. Cover and let marinate in a refrigerator for 2 hours.
        
        </li>
        <li>Add a few drops of red food coloring and mix so that chicken becomes tinted with red.
        
        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil, working in batches, and fry, stirring frequently, until browned and no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.
