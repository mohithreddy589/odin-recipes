    <h3>Description about the recipe</h3>
    <p>Nothing makes a Desi kid more nostalgic than a bowl of maggi. While traditionally it’s simply made with the spice packet that comes along with it and some veggies, I created this super-spicy elevated version that I know you’ll love. You’ll never want to eat maggi the regular way again!
